# CQ6
Plus minus*
the time complexity of my code is O(n) because there is a for loop that runs through each item
the space complexity is O(1) because there are 3 doubles stored no matter the size of input

 Ice cream*
 I didn't have time to finish my code but it worked by doing a recursive call on taking and not taking. The reason my code failed is because i didn't have enough time to perfectly set whether it should return the take or not take call.
As you see from my image, the code ran and just got stuck having the first index be picked. Besides that the logic was there and correct.
